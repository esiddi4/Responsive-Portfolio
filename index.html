				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<img class="profile-img" src="assets/images/headshot.jpg" alt="Enas Headshot" height="300">
				<p><em>An aspiring web developer committed to making a significant and positive impact wheresoever I go.</em></p>

				<p>I was born and raised in Elmhurst, a suburb ~20 miles west of Chicago, where I also attended college. After graduating from Elmhurst College in 2016 with a degree in Finance and Economics, I realized a career in Finance was not for me and accepted a Marketing internship at a startup. After much soul-searching, I recognized my skills lie in logic and creativity. *Cue Google search: "careers that use logic and creativity"* Fast forward to today and I am so happy I now get to call the beautiful city of Chicago my home and attend Northwestern University's Coding Bootcamp to help jumpstart my career as a web developer!</p>

				<p>Aside from coding, you can find me drinking coffee, enjoying the outdoors (except in Chicago winters...brrr), shooting portrait photography, practicing Muay Thai kickboxing, cooking comfort food, and listening to podcasts/reading books about Self-Development, Psychology, Spirituality, and Business. </p>
